# **Optical Character Recognition**

**Aim** : The goal of the project is to predict the next character from the previous set of words or sentences. 

  The principle behind Optical Character Recognition (OCR) framework dependent on a lattice foundation is to perform Document Image Analysis, report preparing of electronic 
record designs changed over from paper arranges all the more viably and productively. This works on the exactness of perceiving the characters during record preparing contrasted 
with different existing accessible person acknowledgment techniques. Here OCR procedure determines the importance of the characters, their textual style properties from their 
spot planned pictures. The essential goal is to accelerate the cycle of character acknowledgment in report preparing. The characters, words, sentences and anything which an image
contains, OCR helps to recognize them and can even cut and copy the words that image contains in it. The main scope of our project Optical Character Recognition is to give a 
productive and improved programming apparatus for the clients to perform Document Image Analysis, archive handling by perusing and perceiving the characters in research, scholarly,
administrative and business associations that are having enormous pool of reported, checked pictures.
